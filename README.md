# Sentinel

A modular command-line security assessment toolkit built with Python.

Sentinel is the flagship project of **Project Ascend**.

The goal is to build a professional, modular security assessment toolkit while progressively learning Python, networking, software engineering, and artificial intelligence. Instead of creating many small practice projects, Sentinel evolves every week as I learn new concepts.

## Vision

Sentinel will allow a user to assess a domain or an IP address against a variety of security checks. Eventually, the application will support:

- **DNS Analysis**
- **TLS / SSL Configuration & Certificate Inspection**
- **Open Port Detection**
- **HTTP Security Headers & Web Technology Detection**
- **Email Security** (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- **AI-powered Security Summaries**

The project is inspired by common security assessment techniques and is designed as a learning platform rather than a commercial security scanner.

## Current Features (v0.2.1)

- **Interactive CLI**: Menu-driven target selection interface with full user validation.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Assessment sub-menu contextually tracks the selected asset.
- **Modular Package Architecture**: Core scanner engines completely decoupled into a standalone `scanners` package using package-level imports.
- **Global Termination Execution**: Quick system-level exit capability safely embedded directly within the deep loop framework.
